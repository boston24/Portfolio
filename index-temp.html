                    I am a sophomore Computer Science student looking forward to gaining his first experience in the
                    IT industry. Thanks to his college classes Mateusz has already had a chance to learn about OOP,
                    databases, a couple of programming languages and various algorithms. Mateusz also does not shy away
                    from self-improvement by learning or improving his programming skills and doing projects in his free
                    time. Mateusz is not afraid of challenges. He loves to learn new things and to overcome current
                    problems. Mateusz is eager to get involved in a real project when he can share his strengths to help his
                    team.
